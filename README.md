# Goals
* We are trying to create mazes for different levels of our games and are looking for assets to design the game with. 
* Our next goal is to code our game and merge everything.

# Workload

* All developers design one level to their liking, which can be used for every level. 
* We plan to divide the workload into equal sections among each member.
* The same goes for assets and art of the game.
